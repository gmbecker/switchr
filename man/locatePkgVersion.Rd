\description{
Locate and download/build the exact version of a single package.
}
\note{
Locating and attempting to install a non-current version of a single
will not work in general, due to dependency issues. In most cases a
Just-in-Time repository should be created and used instead, e.g. via
\code{\link{install_packages}}

This function is called internally during the construction of Just-in-Time
repositories and during the installation of specific package versions.
