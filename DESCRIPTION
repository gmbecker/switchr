Description: Provides an abstraction for managing, installing,
    and switching between sets of installed R packages. This allows users to
    maintain multiple package libraries simultaneously, e.g. to maintain
    strict, package-version-specific reproducibility of many analyses, or
    work within a devel/release paradigm. Introduces a generalized package
    installation process which supports multiple repository and 
    non-repository sources and tracks package provenance.
